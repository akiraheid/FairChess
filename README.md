# Fair Chess
We love chess, but is it fair?

With this twist on regular chess, Fair Chess implements the [fairest sharing sequence](https://youtu.be/prh72BLNjIk) for the turn order.

## Rules
The same rules as regular chess but with the turn order changed! Some side effects of that new rule:
* Kings can be taken as a second move
* Players can't move through check

## Support
Check out the projects that made this possible:
* [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js)
* [chessboard.js](https://github.com/oakmac/chessboardjs/)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com)
